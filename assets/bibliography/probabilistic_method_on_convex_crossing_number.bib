abstract = {We consider the number of crossings in a random embedding of a graph, $G$, with vertices in convex position. We give explicit formulas for the mean and variance of the number of crossings as a function of various subgraph counts of $G$. Using Stein's method and size-bias coupling, we prove an upper bound on the Kolmogorov distance between the distribution of the number of crossings and a standard normal random variable. As an application, we establish central limit theorems, along with convergence rates, for the number of crossings in random matchings, path graphs, cycle graphs, and the disjoint union of triangles.},

@article{Feray2016,
abstract = {The theory of dependency graphs is a powerful toolbox to prove asymptotic normality of sums of random variables. In this article, we introduce a more general notion of weighted dependency graphs and give normality criteria in this context. We also provide generic tools to prove that some weighted graph is a weighted dependency graph for a given family of random variables. To illustrate the power of the theory, we give applications to the following objects: uniform random pair partitions, the random graph model $G(n,M)$, uniform random permutations, the symmetric simple exclusion process and multilinear statistics on Markov chains. The application to random permutations gives a bivariate extension of a functional central limit theorem of Janson and Barbour. On Markov chains, we answer positively an open question of Bourdon and Vall\'ee on the asymptotic normality of subword counts in random texts generated by a Markovian source.},
