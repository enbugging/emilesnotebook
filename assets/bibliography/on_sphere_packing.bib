@article{Leppmeier2019,
abstract = {The famous Kepler conjecture has a less spectacular, two-dimensional equivalent: The theorem of Thue states that the densest circle packing in the Euclidean plane has a hexagonal structure. A common proof uses Voronoi cells and analyzes their area applying Jensen's inequality on convex functions to receive a local estimate which is globally valid. Based on the concept of Voronoi cells, we will introduce a new tessellation into so-called L-triangles which can be related to fundamental parallelograms of lattice circle packings. Therefore a globally disordered circle packing can be reduced to locally ordered configurations: We will show how the theorem of Lagrange on lattice circle packings can be applied to non-lattice circle packings. Thus we receive a new proof of Thue's theorem.},

As a result, we obtain new upper bounds on the sphere packing density in dimension 4 through 7 and 9 through 16. We also give a different three-point bound for lattice packing and conjecture that this second bound is sharp in dimension 4.},

@article{Li2022,
abstract = {The Cohn-Elkies linear program for sphere packing, which was used to solve the 8 and 24 dimensional cases, is conjectured to not be sharp in any other dimension $d>2$. By mapping feasible points of this infinite-dimensional linear program into a finite-dimensional problem via discrete reduction, we provide a general method to obtain dual bounds on the Cohn-Elkies linear program. This reduces the number of variables to be finite, enabling computer optimization techniques to be applied. Using this method, we prove that the Cohn-Elkies bound cannot come close to the best packing densities known in dimensions $3 \leq d \leq 13$ except for the solved case $d=8$. In particular, our dual bounds show the Cohn-Elkies bound is unable to solve the 3, 4, and 5 dimensional sphere packing problems.},
