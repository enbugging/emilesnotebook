abstract = {Can replication and translation emerge in a single mechanism via self-assembly? The key molecule, transfer RNA (tRNA), is one of the most ancient molecules and contains the genetic code. Our experiments show how a pool of oligonucleotides, adapted with minor mutations from tRNA, spontaneously formed molecular assemblies and replicated information autonomously using only reversible hybridization under thermal oscillations. The pool of cross-complementary hairpins self-selected by agglomeration and sedimentation. The metastable DNA hairpins bound to a template and then interconnected by hybridization. Thermal oscillations separated replicates from their templates and drove an exponential, cross-catalytic replication. The molecular assembly could encode and replicate binary sequences with a replication fidelity corresponding to 85–90 % per nucleotide. The replication by a self-assembly of tRNA-like sequences suggests that early forms of tRNA could have been involved in molecular replication. This would link the evolution of translation to a mechanism of molecular replication.},

abstract = {Gene therapy and its role in the medical field have evolved drastically in recent decades. Studies aim to define DNA-based medicine as well as encourage innovation and the further development of novel approaches. Gene therapy has been established as an alternative approach to treat a variety of diseases. Its range of mechanistic applicability is wide; gene therapy has the capacity to address the symptoms of disease, the body's ability to fight disease, and in some cases has the ability to cure disease, making it a more attractive intervention than some traditional approaches to treatment (i.e., medicine and surgery). Such versatility also suggests gene therapy has the potential to address a greater number of indications than conventional treatments. Many DNA-based therapies have shown promise in clinical trials, and several have been approved for use in humans. Whereas current treatment regimens for chronic disease often require frequent dosing, DNA-based therapies can produce robust and durable expression of therapeutic genes with fewer treatments. This benefit encourages the application of DNA-based gene therapy to manage chronic diseases, an area where improving efficiency of current treatments is urgent. Here, we provide an overview of two DNA-based gene therapies as well as their delivery methods: adeno associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapy and plasmid DNA (pDNA)-based gene therapy. We will focus on how these therapies have already been utilized to improve treatment of chronic disease, as well as how current literature supports the expansion of these therapies to treat additional chronic indications in the future.},

@article{Wang1979,
abstract = {The helical repeat of DNA in solution has been measured directly by analyzing the gel electrophoretic patterns of pairs of covalently closed DNAs with length differences between 1 and 58 base pairs, out of a total length of about 4350 base pairs per DNA molecule. The method is based on the observation that for a covalently closed DNA of a fixed size of n base pairs (n of the order of several thousand), under appropriate conditions, two topological isomers (topoisomers) differing by 1 in their linking numbers are well resolved by gel electrophoresis. If the size of the DNA is increased to n + x base pairs, unless x is an integral multiple of the helical repeat h, the bands of the topoisomers with n + x base pairs per molecule are all shifted relative to the bands of the topoisomers with n base pairs per molecule. The magnitude of the shift is directly related to the nonintegral residual of x/n. Analysis of the set with x ranging from 1 to 58 gives the DNA helix repeat in solution as 10.4 base pairs per turn under physiological conditions, with an estimated probable error of +/- 0.1. This result strongly supports the double helix structure of DNA and rejects the side-by-side model of Rodley et al. [Rodley, G.A., Scobie, R.S., Bates, R.H. T & Lewitt, R.M. (1976) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 73, 2959-2963]. The helical repeat of DNA measured in solution is significantly different from the value 10.0 base pairs per turn for the B form fiber structure.},

The stresses help the bundles assemble into objects on the scale of tens of nanometers. Both the direction and degree of bending could be controlled, and curvatures as tight as 6 nanometers achieved. Complex shapes, such as square-toothed gears, could be created by combining multiple curved elements.},

abstract = {Almost all RNAs can fold to form extensive base-paired secondary structures. Many of these structures then modulate numerous fundamental elements of gene expression. Deducing these structure–function relationships requires that it be possible to predict RNA secondary structures accurately. However, RNA secondary structure prediction for large RNAs, such that a single predicted structure for a single sequence reliably represents the correct structure, has remained an unsolved problem. Here, we demonstrate that quantitative, nucleotide-resolution information from a SHAPE experiment can be interpreted as a pseudo-free energy change term and used to determine RNA secondary structure with high accuracy. Free energy minimization, by using SHAPE pseudo-free energies, in conjunction with nearest neighbor parameters, predicts the secondary structure of deproteinized Escherichia coli 16S rRNA (>1,300 nt) and a set of smaller RNAs (75–155 nt) with accuracies of up to 96–100%, which are comparable to the best accuracies achievable by comparative sequence analysis.},

@article{Keating2011,
abstract = {Unlike proteins, the RNA backbone has numerous degrees of freedom (eight, if one counts the sugar pucker), making RNA modeling, structure building and prediction a multidimensional problem of exceptionally high complexity. And yet RNA tertiary structures are not infinite in their structural morphology; rather, they are built from a limited set of discrete units. In order to reduce the dimensionality of the RNA backbone in a physically reasonable way, a shorthand notation was created that reduced the RNA backbone torsion angles to two ($\eta$ and $\theta$, analogous to $\phi$ and $\psi$ in proteins). When these torsion angles are calculated for nucleotides in a crystallographic database and plotted against one another, one obtains a plot analogous to a Ramachandran plot (the $\eta$/$\theta$ plot), with highly populated and unpopulated regions. Nucleotides that occupy proximal positions on the plot have identical structures and are found in the same units of tertiary structure. In this review, we describe the statistical validation of the $\eta$/$\theta$ formalism and the exploration of features within the $\eta$/$\theta$ plot. We also describe the application of the $\eta$/$\theta$ formalism in RNA motif discovery, structural comparison, RNA structure building and tertiary structure prediction. More than a tool, however, the $\eta$/$\theta$ formalism has provided new insights into RNA structure itself, revealing its fundamental components and the factors underlying RNA architectural form.},

abstract = {The expression of genes, both coding and noncoding, can be significantly influenced by RNA structural features of their corresponding transcripts. There is by now mounting experimental and some theoretical evidence that structure formation in vivo starts during transcription and that this cotranscriptional folding determines the functional RNA structural features that are being formed. Several decades of research in bioinformatics have resulted in a wide range of computational methods for predicting RNA secondary structures. Almost all state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy, however, completely ignore the process of structure formation and focus exclusively on the final RNA structure. This review hopes to bridge this gap. We summarize the existing evidence for cotranscriptional folding and then review the different, currently used strategies for RNA secondary-structure prediction. Finally, we propose a range of ideas on how state-of-the-art methods could be potentially improved by explicitly capturing the process of cotranscriptional structure formation.},

abstract = {The dnaG protein of Escherichia coli initiates DNA replication by synthesizing primer oligonucleotides for elongation by DNA polymerae. The experiments reported here probe the nature of the nucleic acid element recognized by the dnaG protein. Three well-separated groups of nucleotides within the negative-strand origin of the single-stranded phage phi K are protected by the dnaG protein against nuclease digestion. DNA as far as 115 bases from the start site of primer synthesis is involved in binding of the dnaG protein to the replication origin. One molecule of dnaG protein could protect all of these nucleotides if the DNA were folded into a higher-order tertiary structure. Protection of the phi K origin by dnaG protein requires DNA binding protein, and it does not occur if the group of protected nucleotides most distant from the start site is removed from the template. There is no binding of dnaG protein to the complementary strand of the phi K origin-region DNA. The observed protection of the positive strand is due to a functional nucleic acid-protein complex.},

@article{Nussinov1980,
abstract = {A computer method is presented for finding the most stable secondary structures in long single-stranded RNAs. It is 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than existing codes. The time required for its application increases as N3 for a chain N nucleotides long. As many as 1000 nucleotides can be searched in a single run. The approach is systematic and builds an optimal structure in a straightforward inductive procedure based on an exact mathematical algorithm. Two simple half-matrices are constructed and the best folded form is read directly from the second matrix by a simple back-tracking procedure. The program utilizes published values for base-pairing energies to compute one structure with the lowest free energy.},

abstract = {The oxDNA model of Deoxyribonucleic acid has been applied widely to systems in biology, biophysics and nanotechnology. It is currently available via two independent open source packages. Here we present a set of clearly documented exemplar simulations that simultaneously provide both an introduction to simulating the model, and a review of the model's fundamental properties. We outline how simulation results can be interpreted in terms of—and feed into our understanding of—less detailed models that operate at larger length scales, and provide guidance on whether simulating a system with oxDNA is worthwhile.},

@article{Fan2020,
abstract = {DNA computing is recognized as one of the most outstanding candidates of next‐generation molecular computers that perform Boolean logic using DNAs as basic elements. Benefiting from DNAs' inherent merits of low‐cost, easy‐synthesis, excellent biocompatibility, and high programmability, DNA computing has evoked substantial interests and gained burgeoning advancements in recent decades, and also exhibited amazing magic in smart bio‐applications. In this review, recent achievements of DNA logic computing systems using multifarious materials as building blocks are summarized. Initially, the operating principles and functions of different logic devices (common logic gates, advanced arithmetic and non‐arithmetic logic devices, versatile logic library, etc.) are elaborated. Afterward, state‐of‐the‐art DNA computing systems based on diverse “toolbox” materials, including typical functional DNA motifs (aptamer, metal‐ion dependent DNAzyme, G‐quadruplex, i‐motif, triplex, etc.), DNA tool‐enzymes, non‐DNA biomaterials (natural enzyme, protein, antibody), nanomaterials (AuNPs, magnetic beads, graphene oxide, polydopamine nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, DNA‐templated nanoclusters, upconversion nanoparticles, quantum dots, etc.) or polymers, 2D/3D DNA nanostructures (circular/interlocked DNA, DNA tetrahedron/polyhedron, DNA origami, etc.) are reviewed. The smart bio‐applications of DNA computing to the fields of intelligent analysis/diagnosis, cell imaging/therapy, amongst others, are further outlined. More importantly, current “Achilles' heels” and challenges are discussed, and future promising directions of this field are also recommended.},

@article{Shibata2017,
abstract = {Nucleic acid nanotechnology has great potential for future therapeutic applications. However, the construction of nanostructured devices that control cell fate by detecting and amplifying protein signals has remained a challenge. Here we design and build protein-driven RNA-nanostructured devices that actuate in vitro by RNA-binding-protein-inducible conformational change and regulate mammalian cell fate by RNA–protein interaction-mediated protein assembly. The conformation and function of the RNA nanostructures are dynamically controlled by RNA-binding protein signals. The protein-responsive RNA nanodevices are constructed inside cells using RNA-only delivery, which may provide a safe tool for building functional RNA–protein nanostructures. Moreover, the designed RNA scaffolds that control the assembly and oligomerization of apoptosis-regulatory proteins on a nanometre scale selectively kill target cells via specific RNA–protein interactions. These findings suggest that synthetic RNA nanodevices could function as molecular robots that detect signals and localize target proteins, induce RNA conformational changes, and programme mammalian cellular behaviour.},
